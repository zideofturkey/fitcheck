# Business API Design Specification - `Get Mymacrotarget`

A Business API is a set of logical actions centered around a main data object. These actions can range from simple CRUD operations to complex workflows that implement intricate business logic.

While the term “API” traditionally refers to an interface that allows software systems to interact, in Mindbricks a Business API represents a broader concept. It encapsulates a business workflow around a data object, going beyond basic CRUD operations to include rich, internally coordinated actions that can be fully designed and customized.

This document provides an in-depth explanation of the architectural design of the `getMyMacroTarget` Business API. It is intended to guide backend architects and developers in maintaining the current design. Additionally, frontend developers and frontend AI agents can use this document to understand how to properly consume this API on the client side.

## Main Data Object and CRUD Operation
The `getMyMacroTarget` Business API is designed to handle a `get` operation on the `MacroTarget` data object. This operation is performed under the specified conditions and may include additional, coordinated actions as part of the workflow.

## API Description

Fetch the authenticated user's current active macro target.

## API Frontend Description By The Backend Architect

Called on page load of the Macro Targets page. Returns the current active target to pre-fill the form. If response is 404, show the form empty with placeholder hint values.

## API Options

* **Raise Api Event** : `false`
Indicates whether the Business API should emit an API-level event after successful execution. This is typically used for audit trails, analytics, or external integrations.
Note that the DB-Level events for `create`, `update` and `delete` operations will always be raised for internal reasons.

* **Active Check** : ``
Controls how the system checks if a record is active (not soft-deleted or inactive). Uses the `ApiCheckOption` to determine whether this is checked during the query or after fetching the instance.

* **Read From Entity Cache** : `false`
If enabled, the API will attempt to read the target object from the Redis entity cache before querying the database. This can improve performance for frequently accessed records.

## API Controllers
A Mindbricks Business API can be accessed through multiple interfaces, including REST, gRPC, WebSocket, Kafka, or Cron. The controllers listed below map the business workflow to a specific interface, enabling consistent interaction regardless of the communication channel.

### REST Controller

The `getMyMacroTarget` Business API includes a REST controller that can be triggered via the following route:

`/v1/macro-targets/me`

By sending a request to this route using the service API address, you can execute this Business API. Parameters can be provided in multiple HTTP locations, including the URL path, URL query, request body, and request headers. Detailed information about these parameters is provided in the **Parameters** section.




### MCP Tool

REST controllers also expose the Business API as a tool in the MCP, making it accessible to AI agents. This `getMyMacroTarget` Business API will be registered as a tool on the MCP server within the service binding.

## API Parameters


The `getMyMacroTarget` Business API does not require any parameters to be provided from the controllers.

## AUTH Configuration

The **authentication and authorization configuration** defines the core access rules for the `getMyMacroTarget` Business API. These checks are applied **after parameter validation** and before executing the main business logic.

While these settings cover the most common scenarios, more **fine-grained or conditional access control**—such as permissions based on object context, nested memberships, or custom workflows—should be implemented using explicit actions like `PermissionCheckAction`, `MembershipCheckAction`, or `ObjectPermissionCheckAction`.


### Login Requirement


This API **requires login** (`loginRequired = true`). Requests from non-logged-in users will return a **401 Unauthorized** error.
Login is necessary **but not sufficient**, as additional role, permission, or other authorization checks may still apply.

### Ownership Checks



---

### Role and Permission Settings


- **Absolute roles** (bypass all auth checks):  
  Users with any of the following roles will bypass all authentication and authorization checks, including ownership, membership, and standard role/permission checks:  
  `[superAdmin]`






---


## Select Clause
Specifies which fields will be selected from the main data object during a `get` or `list` operation. Leave blank to select all properties. This applies only to `get` and `list` type APIs.",

``


## Where Clause
Defines the criteria used to locate the target record(s) for the main operation. This is expressed as a query object and applies to `get`, `list`, `update`, and `delete` APIs. All API types except `list` are expected to affect a single record.

*If nothing is configured for (get, update, delete) the id fields will be the select criteria.*

**Select By**: 
A list of fields that must be matched exactly as part of the WHERE clause. This is not a filter — it is a required selection rule. In single-record APIs (`get`, `update`, `delete`), it defines how a unique record is located. In `list` APIs, it scopes the results to only entries matching the given values.
Note that `selectBy` fields will be ignored if `fullWhereClause` is set.

*The business api configuration has no `selectBy` setting.*


**Full Where Clause** 
An MScript query expression that overrides all default WHERE clause logic. Use this for fully customized queries.
When `fullWhereClause` is set, `selectBy` is ignored, however additional selects will still be applied to final where clause.

The business api configuration has a `fullWhereClause` setting :
```js
{ userId: this.session.userId, isActive: true }
```


**Additional Clauses**
A list of conditionally applied MScript query fragments. These clauses are appended only if their conditions evaluate to true. If no condition is set it will be applied to the where clause directly.

The business api configuration has no additionalClauses setting.


**Actual Where Clause** 
This where clause is built using whereClause configuration (if set) and default business logic.

```js
runMScript(() => ({$and:[{ userId: this.session.userId, isActive: true },{isActive:true}]}), {"path":"services[2].businessLogic[1].whereClause.fullWhereClause"})
```







## Get Options
Use these options to set `get` specific settings.

**setAsRead**: 
An optional array of field-value mappings that will be updated after the read operation. Useful for marking items as read or viewed.

No `setAsread` field-value pair is configured.





   
## Business Logic Workflow 


### [1] Step : startBusinessApi

## Rest Usage


### Rest Client Parameters
Client parameters are the api parameters that are visible to client and will be populated by the client.
Note that some api parameters are not visible to client because they are populated by internal system, session, calculation or joint sources.
The `getMyMacroTarget` api has got no visible parameters.    

### REST Request
To access the api you can use the **REST** controller with the path **GET  /v1/macro-targets/me**
```js
  axios({
    method: 'GET',
    url: '/v1/macro-targets/me',
    data: {
    
    },
    params: {
    
        }
  });
```   
### REST Response
The API response is encapsulated within a JSON envelope. Successful operations return an HTTP status code of 200 for get, list, update, or delete requests, and 201 for create requests. Each successful response includes a `"status": "OK"` property. For error handling, refer to the "Error Response" section.

Following JSON represents the most comprehensive form of the **`macroTarget`** object in the respones. However, some properties may be omitted based on the object's internal logic.


```json
{
	"status": "OK",
	"statusCode": "200",
	"elapsedMs": 126,
	"ssoTime": 120,
	"source": "db",
